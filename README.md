# SQL Library Manager

## Build status

Completed 10.06.2021

## Language / Framework

Node.js

Express.js

SQL/sequelize

CSS/HTML

## Features
A database web application for storing, editing and deleting a list of library books.

Pagination has been added but has some UX design flaws, mainly being that the search function now only searches through the current page. 
Its fine for this demonstration but would make finding a particular book in a large database excruciating.
I believe creating a Rest API would be the best way to fix this (so that the search function can sort through all data) but I am yet to learn this so will continue with the course and come back to this issue.
